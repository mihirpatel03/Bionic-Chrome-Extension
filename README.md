# Bionic-Chrome-Extension
A chrome extension which highlights optimal courses for a student on Haverford College/Bryn Mawr College's academic portal.

## Description

Uses python dictonaries to store the prerequisites and meeting times of each class taught in the fall 2022 semester at
the Haverford College/Bryn Mawr College Bi-Co Consortium. With that information, the chrome extension will modify the search tab on 
Bionic, the academic portal for these institutions. Classes that fit the schedule of the student will be highlighted in green, 
and conflicts in red. Every class that has a prerequisite will have the prerequisites listed on in the search tab. The goal of this is to
save students time in the often tedious process of course selection. Instead of having to keep track of the meeting times of their current
enrolled classes, the extension does it for them. Instead of having to click on each class one by one and read a lengthy paragraph
to find if they can even take the course because of prerequisites, this saves time and effort by simply displaying it on the main page.
